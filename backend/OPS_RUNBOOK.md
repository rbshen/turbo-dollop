# Ops Runbook

Lightweight notes on spotting silent failures in Fathom's cron jobs. Not a
general operations manual — just entries for failure modes that have
actually happened and weren't caught quickly.

## Weekly index constituent refresh (S&P 500 / Dow)

Cron: `crontab.txt`, Sundays 1:00 AM (S&P 500) and 1:05 AM (Dow). Scripts:
`scrapers/refresh_sp500_list.py`, `scrapers/refresh_dow_list.py`.

**Known failure mode (2026-08-02 -- 2026-08-05): silent `IntegrityError`
rollback.** A bug in `scrapers/index_scraper.py::sync_index_constituents`
(fixed -- see git history around 2026-08-05) let SQLAlchemy flush new
rows' INSERTs before old rows' DELETEs, tripping the
`uq_index_constituent` unique constraint whenever a ticker appeared in
both the old and new list (the normal case, since index membership rarely
changes). The failure was caught inside the transaction and rolled back
cleanly, so there was no data corruption -- but the constituent table also
silently stopped updating, for over two weeks, with no alert.

**How to check this isn't happening again:**

1. Tail the cron logs -- a healthy run logs `"<Index> constituent refresh
   succeeded: N tickers stored"` from `scrapers.index_scraper`:
   ```
   tail -20 backend/logs/sp500_list_refresh_cron.log
   tail -20 backend/logs/dow_list_refresh_cron.log
   ```
   A run that instead shows a Python traceback (e.g.
   `sqlalchemy.exc.IntegrityError`) or an `ERROR` line means the sync
   failed and the stored list was left unchanged.
2. Check `last_synced_at` directly against today's date -- it should
   never be more than ~7 days stale (both jobs run weekly):
   ```
   uv run python -c "
   from sqlmodel import Session, select
   from core.db import engine
   from core.models import IndexConstituent
   with Session(engine) as session:
       for idx in ['sp500', 'dow']:
           rows = session.exec(select(IndexConstituent).where(IndexConstituent.index_name == idx)).all()
           synced = sorted(r.last_synced_at for r in rows)
           print(idx, 'count=', len(rows), 'last_synced_at=', synced[-1] if synced else 'EMPTY')
   "
   ```

No automated alerting exists for this yet (out of scope for now) -- this
is a manual check to run if a ticker's index membership looks stale or
wrong in the app.
