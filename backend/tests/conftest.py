"""Session-scoped safety net: fails loudly, immediately, if any test writes
to the REAL `core.db.engine` instead of a properly-isolated in-memory test
engine -- the exact root cause of the PEP/ACME fixture-contamination
incidents (see CLAUDE.md's "Ad-hoc reproduction scripts must not touch the
real database"). A missing `monkeypatch.setattr(some_module, "engine",
test_engine)` now surfaces as an immediate, loud test failure with a clear
message, instead of a silent write that can sit undetected in production
for days.

Hooks the database driver itself (`before_cursor_execute`), not
`cache.get_or_fetch` specifically -- this catches every write path,
including ones this comment can't anticipate, not just the one call site
the original incidents happened to go through.

Registered once, for the pytest process's entire lifetime, via a
session-scoped autouse fixture. This never affects the real app: a normal
interactive run or a cron job never imports pytest and never constructs
this fixture, so `core.db.engine` never gets this listener attached
outside of a pytest session."""

    freshness -- see core/cache.py::get_or_fetch_earnings_aware. fmp_client is
    a true singleton (`clients/fmp_client.py::fmp_client = FMPClient()`), so
    patching it once here applies across every module that imported it by
    reference. Defaults get_earnings to an empty response so a test exercising
    a live (non-cache_only) fetch path doesn't silently make a real network
    call just because it doesn't itself care about earnings-date-aware
    staleness -- an empty list makes most_recent_reported_earnings_date return
    None, which falls back to the same flat-window behavior these tests'
    existing call-count assertions were already written against. A test that
    DOES care sets its own monkeypatch.setattr(fmp_client, "get_earnings", ...)
    afterward, which simply overrides this default (same object, last write
